# LondonTubeShortestDistanceFinder

Aim : 
The main.py file has the findShortestPath() function that takes names of two tube stations within zone one London and returns the shortest path to get from the first tube station to the second. 
The algorithm primarily makes use of the breadth first search concept. 

Reference: 
I used https://www.101computing.net/london-underground-journey-planner/ to get information on all station nodes
