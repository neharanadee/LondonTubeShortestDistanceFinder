# LondonTubeShortestDistanceFinder

Aim : 

The main.py file has the findShortestPath() function that takes in names of two tube stations within zone one London and returns the shortest path to get from the first tube station to the second. 
The algorithm used here is breadth first search. 

Reference: 
I used https://www.101computing.net/london-underground-journey-planner/ to get information on all station nodes
